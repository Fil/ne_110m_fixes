## Natural Earth 110m vector data, fixed & packaged

- fixes topological issues on the border of Sudan
- uses UN definition for Morrocco / Western Sahara
- adds a few Kuril Islands
- adds Gaza
- keeps all properties fields from NE
- also export countries and land in GeoJSON
- fixes id=578 for Norway and publishes id in the tsv file
- countries with no official iso_n3 code receive a negative id

## Usage

You can use this as a drop-in replacement for [world-atlas](https://github.com/topojson/world-atlas) 110m data:

In TopoJSON:
```{javascript}
fetch('https://unpkg.com/ne110m_fixes/world/110m.json').then(d => d.json())
```

In GeoJSON:
```{javascript}
fetch('https://unpkg.com/ne110m_fixes/world/110m_land.geojson').then(d => d.json())
```

With d3:
In GeoJSON:
```{javascript}
d3.json('https://unpkg.com/ne110m_fixes/world/110m_countries.geojson')
```
